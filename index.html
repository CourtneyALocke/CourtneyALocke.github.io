         Welcome to my Personal Page.</h3>
        
       		<p>Passionate, energetic and tech-loving Monmouth University Software Engineering major. <br>
         	 <br>      
             My first experience with code was teaching myself HTML when I was 12 years old. I was sick of the white, blue, and orange pages that most users were forced to live with. With HTML, I could tailor my Myspace page to my own personality. <br>
             <br>
Ever since then I have been fascinated by what I could really do with a computer. Whether it was taking apart my Dell Dimension e521 to learn each component, to looking up and working on challenging coding problems on Project Euler, or enjoying weekend nights raiding on World of Warcraft, I loved being surrounded by technology. <br>
             <br>                  
         	 When outside of classes, my weekends are filled with entertainment, where I participate as the Vice President of Finance and Logistics for the main programming organization on campus, Student Activities Board. Being apart of this organization on campus gives me the chance to mesh the world of entertainment with technology. My most current project within the organization is taking the club digital by integrating cloud storage for all of our documentation.<br>
         	 I also enjoy spending my time on YouTube looking up makeup tutorials and pretending to be an HGTV star.<br>
         	 <br>
         	 Currently searching the world for a goal career where I can merge my love of software with the high energy of the entertainment business.
